OSeMOSYS is a full-fledged systems optimization model for long-run energy planning. Unlike long established energy systems models, 
such as MARKAL/TIMES (ETSAP, 2010), MESSAGE (IAEA, 2010), PRIMES (NTUA, 2010), EFOM (Van der Voort, 1982) and POLES (Enerdata, 2010), 
OSeMOSYS potentially requires a less significant learning curve and time commitment to build and operate. 
Additionally, by not using proprietary software or commercial programming languages and solvers, OSeMOSYS requires no upfront financial 
investment. These two advantages extend the availability of energy modeling to large communities of students, business analysts, 
government specialists, and developing countries energy researchers.

OSeMOSYS is designed to be easily updated and modified to suit the needs of a particular analysis.To provide this capability, the model 
is being developed in a series of component ‘blocks’ of functionality. A collection of the functional component blocks combines to 
form a customized model. Further, each block is divided into different levels of abstraction as follows:
I. A plain English description of the model sets, parameters, variables, constraints, and objectives as well as how they are related.
II. An algebraic formulation of the plain English description.
III. The model’s implementation in a programming language.
IV. The application of the model, which depends on how it is being used in astudy.
